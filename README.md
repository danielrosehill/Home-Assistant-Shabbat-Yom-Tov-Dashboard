# Home Assistant Shabbat & Yom Tov Dashboard

The purpose of this repository is to share my Shabbat and Yom Tov Home Assistant dashboards as I tweak and improve them.

If you want to replicate the design you're (obviously) going to need to tweak the values in the YAML. As I don't own the copyright to them I won't include the photos I'm using but ... they should be pretty self-explanatory and interchangeable (like the Shabbat candles!).

The modifications I've made to make my dashboard work should be documented elsewhere. 

For instance, I documented the helper I used to roll HebCal's two Shabbat and Yom Tov sensors into one toggle here (either state turns the toggle on and when the states turn off so does the toggle).

**Notation**

I'm using the notation V1V1 for "point" updates (ie, V1.1, V1.2, etc)

The YAML files are nested under the update folder.
